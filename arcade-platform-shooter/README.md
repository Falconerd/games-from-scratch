# Arcade platformer shooter

## TODO in priority order
    - [/] Circle shader
        - Draw circle on a quad, move the quad
        - Also need to scale in the pixel shader to keep pixel perfect
    - [X] Rocket launcher circle animation
        - When the rocket hits something, a shockwave should expand from the impact point
    - [X] Screen-shake
        - Just use stacking timer and magnitude, offset projection?
    - [X] Rocket launcher damage 
        - Find all entities within radius, probably just query all entities since the game is small
    - [X] Weapon knockback/kick
    - [X] Pistol weapon
    - [X] Revolver weapon
        - [X] Large bullets
    - [X] Bullets should not collide more than once with the same enemy
    - [/] Enemy death animations
        - [X] Perhaps make enemies fall off screen
        - [ ] Rotation
    - [X] Rocket launcher acceleration
    - [/] Rocket launcher trail smoke
    - [ ] Text rendering using FreeType
    - [ ] Add debug hotkey
    - [ ] Simple input system
    - [ ] White -> Yellow -> Red explosions
    - [ ] Audio
        - Invesigate options, probably use miniaudio library

        - [ ] Player
        - [ ] Small enemy
        - [ ] Large enemy
    - [ ] Sprite animation system
        - Probably use a simple FSM... Maybe link to entity system
    - [ ] Resolution stuff
        - Currently just runs in windowed more in NES resolution
    - [ ] Profiler
        - Would be nice to see FPS, frame time, etc?
            - nsight, radeon profiler
